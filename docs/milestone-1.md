Karen Son: somanykarens

### Application Idea 
Currently, I would like to implement a application for choosing a game. The data will include different games, game types, and necessary accessories or playing area/field. Additionally, I would like to try adding in user data that could be comments, ratings or likes.

### Functionality 
This application should be used to help people choose a game to play when they can't make a decision or just want to find something new to try. A user will be able to choose based on specifications or filters (i.e. 2 player only or based on age).
