## Application Idea 
The goal of this application will to help users select a game based on specifications and allow users to input their ratings or comments on games. This will help users who are interested in playing a game but can't make a decision or would like to see available games with their specifications. For example, specifications for a four player game that can be finished in an hour might display Scrabble or a role playing game that has no certain play time might display League of Legends. This can display games the user has already played or games they have never played. Each game should have a user-based rating or none, the type, category, number of players, and audience. If available, the game description should also include the game play time and user reviews/comments.

Although I have not personally used an application for this purpose before, I am sure they exist. For example: BGG - Board Game Geek seems like a similar idea but with many more features and specific to board game types only.

## Functionality 
Upon loading the page, the user will be met with a screen displaying the avaialble data types to filter on. Much like the flight tracking application, Hopper, the user will set the initial specifications then the best fitting games will display. If no specifications are set, all games in the database will be displayed in alphabetical order by default, otherwise, they can be sorted based on ratings. Ratings are based on user input (or fake numbers I will put in). Users will also have the ability to input comments/reviews which can display for everyone (much like review of items found on online stores). An additional feature will be "pick any game" which will shuffle available games in database and choose one for the user.
